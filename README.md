# morphingmuts
leaps and bounds

Make character evolve to overcome challenge 
- mut must sniff out clues

Add obstacles to test your hero's ability to leap into action 
- clues lead to protection pieces

Deduct points for anything going out of bouds 
- mut must gather gear before nightfall

Duck, dip, dive and dodge enemies that change or move rapidly 
- enemy: lones wolves or wolf pack


THE YEAR IS 2020 AND YOUVE LOST HOME, UNKWOWN AREA, NIGHT IS SETTING AND HOWLING ADD THE DISTANCE!
ONCE YOU ARE ABLE TO GATHER ALL THE CLUES NEEDED YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND FAMILY...
